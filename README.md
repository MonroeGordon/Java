# Java
Java repository
This repository contains projects I am programming in Java. I am currently working on creating an AI for a chess game. This repository contains a chess zip file that contains all project files, resource files, and code files, including the currently unfinished AI (all current code is runnable however). I also included all source files pertaining to the chess game and its GUI separately.
